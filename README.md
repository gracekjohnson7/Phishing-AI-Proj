# Phishing Email Detection using AI

## About
This project explores how simple machine learning can be used to defend against phishing emails.
Goal was to train a basic AI model to recognize patterns in phishing emails and be able to detect phishing emails from legitimate emails.
Used the **CEAS 2008** and **TREC 2007** databases to create the training/test datasets.
Wrote Java programs to preprocess data.
Used Weka to train four AI models. Achieved **90%+** accuracy.

## Structure
- **'data/'** contains two Java programs for preprocessing data
- **'programs/'** contains example datasets used to train the final model
- **'results/'** contains most successful trained model and a csv file of all the results

## Tools Used
- Java
- Weka
- OpenCSV
- Apache Commons Lang
